 Channels - are used to send messages securely ,
           Channels are independent Objects,channel can be distributed to actors in applications without
           them knowing each other makes highly decoupled architecture which makes individual actors very
           easy to test/debug
          - used to isolate actor and application from one another
          - Only one actor use channel at a time
